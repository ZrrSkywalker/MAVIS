## 👀 About MAVIS

The capabilities of **Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** in **visual math problem-solving** remain insufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks to incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the input diagrams.
